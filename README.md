# Copy your github.com repositories to gitlab.com

In case you want to have a copy of your repositories on gitlab.com ;)

Just create a [personal access token](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens) and call the script:

```
./github2gitlab <GITHUB USERNAME> <GITLAB TOKEN>
```

Have fun :D
